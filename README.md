```bash
git clone https://x-access-token:YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/thealexsoltan/the-ultimate-claude-agents.git rewyse-ai && bash rewyse-ai/install.sh
```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | The AI assistant that runs Rewyse AI |
| **Node.js 18+** | Runs scripts that interact with the Notion API |
| **Notion account** | Where your products are created and delivered |
| **Notion integration** | Gives Rewyse AI permission to read/write your Notion workspace |

Don't worry about setting these up manually — run `/rewyse-onboard` after install and it walks you through everything step by step.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Install** using the command above
2. **Run `/rewyse-onboard`** — guided setup for prerequisites (Node.js, Notion integration, API token)
3. **Run `/build-product`** — start building your first digital product

That's it. The pipeline guides you through every decision with approval gates at each phase.

## How It Works

Rewyse AI runs 10 sequential phases, each handled by a specialized AI agent:

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| 1. **Product Idea** | Define what to build — product type, niche, audience, variables |
| 2. **Build Database** | Create a Notion database with properties and sample entries |
| 3. **Expert Profile** | Build a writing persona — voice, tone, vocabulary, expertise |
| 4. **Content Blueprint** | Define page structure — sections, word counts, formatting |
| 5. **Write Prompt** | Combine expert + blueprint into a generation prompt |
| 6. **Test Content** | Generate 2-3 sample pages for review (quality gate) |
| 7. **Generate Content** | Batch-generate all content in parallel, write to Notion |
| 8. **Design Product** | Create homepage with navigation, icons, shareable link |
| 9. **Product QA** | Scan every page for quality issues |
| 10. **Product Expand** | Suggest complementary products to build next |

**Time to build:** 45-120 minutes depending on product size.

Every phase pauses for your approval. You can go back, revise, or skip ahead. If you close mid-build, run `/build-product {project-name}` to resume exactly where you left off.

## All Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/build-product` | Start or resume a full product build |
| `/product-idea` | Define a product idea (standalone) |
| `/build-database` | Create a Notion database |
| `/expert-profile` | Build an expert writing persona |
| `/content-blueprint` | Define page content structure |
| `/write-prompt` | Assemble the generation prompt |
| `/test-content` | Generate test samples |
| `/generate-content` | Batch-generate all content |
| `/design-product` | Create homepage and navigation |
| `/product-qa` | Run quality assurance scan |
| `/product-expand` | Suggest complementary products |
| `/rewyse-help` | Ask questions, troubleshoot, check status |
| `/rewyse-onboard` | First-time setup walkthrough |

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific about your niche.** "Fitness" is too broad. "Hyrox race nutrition for beginner athletes" is perfect.
2. **The expert profile matters most.** Phase 3 defines the writing voice — take time to review the voice sample.
3. **Phase 6 is your safety net.** Review test samples carefully before committing to full generation.
4. **Start small.** 30-50 entries for your first build. You can always expand later.
5. **Run `/rewyse-help` anytime.** It reads your project state and gives context-aware answers.
