# Rewyse AI — AI Digital Product Agent

A 10-phase pipeline that builds complete digital products in Notion — from idea
definition through content generation to polished delivery.

This directory is **standalone and exportable** — it contains everything needed
to run the full pipeline.

## Pipeline Phases

| Phase | Agent | What It Does |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | build-product | Orchestrates all phases, manages state |
| 1 | product-idea | Defines product type, niche, ICP, variables |
| 2 | build-database | Creates Notion database with properties, views |
| 3 | expert-profile | Builds domain expert persona for content voice |
| 4 | content-blueprint | Defines page structure, sections, word counts |
| 5 | write-prompt | Combines profile + blueprint into generation prompt |
| 6 | test-content | Generates 2-3 sample pages for review |
| 7 | generate-content | Batch processes all entries with parallel agents |
| 8 | design-product | Creates homepage, navigation, icons |
| 9 | product-qa | Scans for quality issues, flags for regen |
| 10 | product-expand | Suggests complementary products |
